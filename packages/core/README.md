## Install

Install this package and other required packages:

```sh
npm install @ization/core lodash
```

## Configure

Import the main module of this package into your app module using `IzCoreModule.withLocales` static method and define locales to be used by this package:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...
    IzCoreModule.withLocales([
      {localeCode: 'en'},
      ...
    ]),
    ...
  ],
  ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

This package does nothing interesting on its own. The actual functionality is provided by plugins. See their docs for more info.

#### `preferLocaleCode(localeCode)` method

Sets locale code as user's preferred locale and saves it for future use.

#### `clearLocaleCodePreference()` method

Clears any saved user's preferred locale.
